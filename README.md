# Cplusplus-Program
# Description
This program uses files of information for a grocery store and displays the information several ways. 
The data is displayed by the amount of product that is sold.
This program uses C++ as well as Python. 

# Program Details
* The highlights of the program are the menu and the Python code to display the data, which is the strongest part of the program. The menu is easy to read and navigate and works on a loop. Once one function is completed, the user is brought back to the menu. Displaying the data sorted and randomized is also a highlight. Allowing the user to see quantities of specific products sold is a very useful function in this program. 

* Code readability and organization needs improvement. The function in C++ that opens a data file and moves the data to an array can be improved by using more concise methods and better organization for code readability. 

* The most difficult portion of code to write was to write the data from a dictionary in Python to a file that was usable in the C++ code. Then, take the data from the file and utilize it to make a star histogram. Getting the data from the file, sorting and placing it into separate vectors was a bit of a challenging task. 

* Some skills required in this project that will be transferable to other projects include combining more than one programming language to use simultaneously. This is a useful skill because it allows you to utilize the best and most efficient parts of different coding languages to make a better program. Many projects utilize more than one coding language in one project, so the skill to be able to accomplish that is valuable. 

* To increase reusability, I used spaces and inline comments to make this program more maintainable, readable, and adaptable. Many of the functions in the Python class work with one another, so as not to repeat unnecessary code. This will allow it to be built upon easily. Making code easy for humans to understand allows it to be more maintainable. Some aspects need improvement, such as the histogram function.
